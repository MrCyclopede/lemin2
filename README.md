# lemin
Lemin is an algorithmic project.

The goal is to maxmize the flow trough a graph of interconected nodes.

This project involved the implementation of various algorithms like: Edmung Karps, Djirka's shortest path, Breadth first search, and some homemade tweaks borrowed from the Depth first search approach.

This is written purely in C without the use of any library functions appart from Malloc, Read and Open.

I made a 3D visualizer for the solution found by the program. It's written in Javascript and uses the Three.JS library.
